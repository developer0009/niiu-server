									How We Collect Your Personal Data

								We collect Your Personal Data from You in
								various ways and at several different points,
								including via telephone (including any form of
								mobile phone text messaging), our Websites, hard

								have consented to disclose Your Personal Data to
								us.

								Subject to the Act, we may also collect and use
								Your Personal Data, from a source other than You
								including any source that is publicly available
								such as social media and other virtual
								communities and networks where people create,
								share or exchange information. Such other
								sources can also include:

							<p className="mb-1">
								- Our authorised representatives whom You have
								corresponded with;
							</p>
							<p className="mb-1">

								another person (“Second Person’s Personal
								Data“), we rely on You to have made him/her
								aware of our Privacy Policy. Before You disclose
								such Second Person’s Personal Data to us, You
								must obtain his/her consent to do so. By
								proceeding to disclose the Second Person’s
								Personal Data to us, You warrant to us that You
								have obtained his/her consent to do so and You
								shall hold us harmless from any action or demand
								that may be taken against us arising out of such
								disclosure by You to us. A number of interactive
								tools or facilities may be available on our
								Websites. If You use any of these tools or
								facilities, we generally do not collect Your
								Personal Data unless a particular tool permits
								You, and You consent by clicking submit or
								performing such act to enable the tool, to
								suspend or save information and recover those
								details at a later time. In these circumstances,
								Your Personal Data may be retained on our

								the choice of whether or not You disclose the
								Personal Data that we request. In addition to
								the purposes mentioned above, we may use
								Personal Data we collect through competitions to
								determine prize winners, award prizes and notify
								winners. We may also use Personal Data that we
								collect through surveys or questionnaires to
								assess Your satisfaction with our products and
								Services and to determine how we may be able to
								better service Your needs.
