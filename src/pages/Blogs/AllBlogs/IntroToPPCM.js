                PPC management is the process of managing a company’s PPC
                strategy and budget. With PPC ad management, you manage your
                campaign in-house or use a PPC agency. No matter who works on
                your campaign, PPC management focuses on creating and optimizing
                your PPC campaign. PPC management is not limited to PPC
                advertising, with most agencies and the companies that hire them
                offering PPC management services for Facebook ads.
              </p>
              <p>
                A quick Google search of "what is pay per click" will bring up a
                variety of articles on ad spend, focused on paid media usage.
                Many large classifieds sites use Pay Per Click Management as
                part their bid process as well creating an added revenue stream
                from readers searching direct messages from large retail sites.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many advertising agencies make their living by managing PPC
                campaigns from a large scope of clients and work directly with
                Pay Per Click companies or agencies depending on the size of
                your budget, keeping ads running either in-house or through an
                agency for any required management. While sometimes it’s best to
                have these services take care of making sure that ads are
                optimized across several different platforms many medium sized
                companies fall within the area of management and can easily
                manage PPC for their small marketing department.

              </div>
              <p>
                PPC campaign management is important because with proactive
                management of your campaigns, your business can make strategic,
                data-driven decisions that improve your pay-per-click
                performance and return on investment. PPC campaigns are short
                term, dynamic and focus on one idea. The second step is the
                creation of a strategy that unifies your online marketing
                efforts and helps distinguish between paid media advertising
                channels.
              </p>

                Everything from Bid calculations to ad copy are scrutinized to
                give you the best possible results.

                <h2>PPC Management Basics</h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                Just as most other aspects of advertising work there are
                step-by-step formulas or know how that encompass any successful
                ad program. Most companies will have a set amount they’re
                willing to spend on ads annually based solely off where you need
                your company in regards to search position, target market and
                competitor numbers (see the pay per click competitive research
                section below). Often this is split into multiple purchase
                schedules with a ten to twenty dollars daily rate for every two
                weeks of PPC management, there isn’t one perfect schedule. The
                more you rely on managed spend because it's required by Google
                some companies may opt to increase budget based upon keywords or
                patterns in search behaviour (GEO targeted search) and over time
                adjust ad spend proportionally to achieve the best performance,
                given that organic traffic is likely to fluctuate based upon
                seasonal trends and other external social factors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Depending on the budget size of your PPC program you can split
                ads between digital display, mobile apps or social media (which
                campaigns tend to be much more expensive). Included in dealing
                with all three channels are optimization techniques including
                bid manipulation where many large advertisers will work directly
                with their agencies who manage ad spend strategically throughout
                several markets across the globe to adjust bids appropriately
                for individual markets.
              </p>
              <p>
                A standard budget with this level of configuration will likely
                encompass a range from about $2,500-$10,000 depending on
                industry targeting and premium SERP placement giving you plenty
                of freedom to build your PPC program in any direction that most
                benefits the business sector within which you operate - they
                just have to fit their budgets large enough at launch so they
                can afford it all. However, larger budgets give more
                possibilities. They can also encourage complexity and allow
                advertisers to experiment with new tactics. This typically
                results in a whole host of variables including bid adjustments
                according to auction dynamics (ex: "Quality Score" which Google
                assigns higher bids) or automated techniques involving bidding
                strategies released by third party firms who sell 'Optimization
                Technology' (GoSearchKey hire key algorithm optimization
                experts). These services will often make their recommendation
                based on an advertiser's competitors, build up a comprehensive
                report giving guidance and recommendations which is then added
                to the AdWords account by using tools such as Text or Excel
                documents. For example: "You can see in this data which links
                have received 80%+ clicks except link, if you add that with your
                other 111%, then it may help competition - etc." All highly
                complex things make their way into the lif ecycle of established
                PPC programs, especially given the bias towards 'optimization'
                in Google's algorithms.

                <h2>Should I hire a PPC management company?</h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                You’re looking at everything PPC campaign management entails.
                After considering all the information, you’re wondering: Should
                I hire a PPC management company? A PPC company can come at a
                great benefit to your business.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let’s look at a few reasons to hire a PPC management agency to
                handle your campaign:
              </p>
              <div className="blog-sub-title">
                <h3>You want to work with someone that specializes in PPC</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                If you and your team aren’t familiar with PPC, it can be a
                challenge to know how to run a campaign successfully. When you
                partner with a PPC campaign management company, you’re
                partnering with experts that know how to create successful
                campaigns.
              </p>
              <div className="blog-sub-title">
                <h3>You want someone to monitor your campaign for you</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                You have a lot on your plate and don’t have the time to run and
                monitor your PPC campaign. Considering 72% of companies haven’t
                looked at ad campaigns in over a month, hiring a PPC company is
                valuable because it can help you stay on top of your campaign.
              </p>
              <div className="blog-sub-title">
                <h3>You want to stay on top of your competition</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                When you have experts working on your PPC campaign, they’ll know
                how to optimize your campaign to get results. That means that
                you’ll compete better with other companies who run PPC ads,
                which means more leads and sales for your business.
              </p>
              <div className="blog-sub-title">
                <h3>You want to save time</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                If you hire a PPC management company, you have more time to
                focus on other projects. PPC campaign management saves your team
                time because you don’t have to carve out the hours to run,
                manage, and monitor your campaign. If you’re looking to partner
                with experts that will save you time and improve your PPC
                results, a PPC company is right for you.
