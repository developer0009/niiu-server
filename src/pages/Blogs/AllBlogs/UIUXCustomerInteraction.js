                User Interface/User Experience, commonly abbreviated as UI/UX,
                is the design and experience of a user's interaction with a
                software product or website. It is one of the most important
                factors in the consumer decision-making process, as well as the
                success of a company's marketing efforts. In short, good UI/UX
                can make or break a product, and it's essential for any business
                or individual looking to stand out from the crowd.

                The UX market has been consolidated since Microsoft first
                popularized it with Surface, and there's no shortage of
                companies distilling their products into an easily digestible
                use case for UI/UX.
              </p>
              <p>
                Microsoft Surface: UI/UX Microsoft is arguably one of the most
                influential companies out there. The Microsoft Surface series of
                hybrid devices act as both a tablet and laptop. One common
                component that has made it among the best-looking devices on the
                entire market is its UI/UX, which lets you flip between using
                just one form factor.
              </p>
              <p>
                AutoDesk: AutoCAD software maps out designs with pretty specific
                graphic representations. We've learned that the format helps
                designers use their imaginations and play around to create
                innovative products, but you can actually check out more of the
                UI/UX for yourself by taking a look at Behance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Uber: Lots of apps have been built to help users seamlessly run
                errands from somewhere in their community (such as libraries),
                but Uber has used design principles of UI/UX to help users
                effectively use a car for what it was meant for: office
                transportation. The interface is pretty clean, intuitive and
                easy to navigate – all the better when you're trying not to fall
                asleep in someone's back seat just so that your drivers aren't
                waiting around on their commute home.
              </p>

                Nike+ FuelBand: Stylish devices are great, but there needs to be
                serious consideration behind them if they want to actually serve
                the end user. When Nike created its FuelBand device, it was
                looking to motivate individuals and companies by encouraging
                healthy living so as not to only look good but also feel well.
                Its UI/UX has allowed users of all backgrounds accomplish great
                feats such as bringing down cholesterol levels or being able to
                conquer a long run on their exercise routine while staying
                within calorie limits.

                OpenTable: At a celebration of the company's 10th anniversary,
                Julie Lythcott-Haims explained to Fast Company how OpenTable has
                set out in order to be useful for all types of restaurants. With
                its UI/UX, restaurants are able (and encouraged) to interact
                with patrons and update their menus based on suggestions from
                search engines. Customers love it because they're not only
                getting great food without long waits, but also services that
                are cherished to keep their floor looking good.

              </div>
              <p>
                Visibility: One of the key elements to an effective interface is
                its visibility. Show what your product does as a niche, but
                avoid leaving final decisions up to the end user (such as
                uploading classifieds online). Rather than presenting that you
                have "classified ads," show it instead by emphasizing
                information on address posting and other services where guests
                can post their current ad listings. By making sure everything's
                clear, people will understand why they're coming to the site and
                what they can expect. Visibility doesn't end with UI/UX but
                rather extends to usability, which presents a product in its
                most meaningful way based on how you interact them (e.g.,
                sending personalizing email messages or connecting phone call
                signals).
              </p>
              <p>
                Gravity: One feature that separates successful products from
                failures is simplicity. The more appealing your interface, the
                less people will overlook how simple it actually was to conduct
                any given task initially on their end – such as finding a
                restaurant or posting an ad in classifieds. This is a multitude
                of impression factors into play and participants who leave
                without taking action could see themselves wasting time if they
                wanted to better use these resources for their own personal
                accounts later on ( especially when backlinking sites lose users
                along the way).
              </p>
              <p>
                Navigation: Take a look through any website and see the bare
                minimum. Look for this, I feel it is so easily overlooked in
                interfaces that have "all or nothing" forms like your 1-page
                site listing out of 500 listings but do not provide links to
                rates by category or menu totals. This can be done through using
                each relevant link correctly within their visual UI/UX due to
                connecting the dots between the external object (e.g., review)
                and the interior object (ad for restaurant).
              </p>
              <p>
                Recognition: Don't rush it. Here's another mistake of having
                rapid developments that sometimes asks "Why?" This can be seen
                in developed small businesses where they may try to achieve a
                quicky look using those many colors and excessive images just to
                keep up with the competition, but the end result is always
                disastrous when you have no idea who their target audience is or
                how will they know – especially if this immediately eliminates
                your potential clients which creates even more applications to
                overcome (or new ones).
              </p>
              <p>
                Brand Loyalty: Your UI/UX design helps people trust your brand
                and creates loyalty! If you are looking to increase brand
                loyalty and subsequent conversions then I would encourage that
                same application developer spend some time in the comments
                section of their newly updated app. The design should place a
                high value on them specifically for your business audience, so
                make sure it's recognized!
              </p>
              <p>
                As we can see, design and user experience play a major role in
                how people interact with technology. There is a massive demand
                for designers and user experience experts in this field, but
                there are also going to be major job opportunities open as the
                digital landscape changes significantly. Designers can take
                advantage of these career opportunities by being prepared with
                knowledge on how users learn new things both online (through web
                design) as well as offline (with UX).
              </p>
              <p>
                By exhibiting good decisions behind Interface/UX Design
                principles we're engaged enough in conversation with our users
                that we can create something great. In the meantime, we need to
                be sure that the tools used in our design process are high
                quality and reliable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember how it starts: with a good base design foundation for
                static documents built on WordPress or any other CMS platform;
                then add your blog posts as pages within this format – followed
                by adding responsive images throughout your website's different
                platforms so you can use them wherever needed. Do not forget
                about what came before all of this when creating an interactive
                web design. This can come in handy when there is a need to
                present information or content, as well writing and preserving
                of data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our interest comes from the visual aspects of interaction with
                technology, which are distinct attributes that we shed light on
                during this course. As such interfaces, we look at will change
                over time but they could be defined by their ability to
                adequately and efficiently facilitate human-computer
                communication so people turn into experts whenever it comes to
                actually using an underlying technology. Designing websites and
                digital products is a highly demanded field, but there are also
                going to be major opportunities open as the digital landscape
                changes significantly.
              </p>

                The importance of user experience cannot be disputed. From the
                moment you open your device, to the time you log in to your
                online accounts, your experience is shaped by the design of your
                user interface and the user experience (UX) consultant who
                designed it. Whether you're a designer or not, it's important to
                know about this process so you can create products that users
                will love. Our website offers comprehensive information on UI/UX
