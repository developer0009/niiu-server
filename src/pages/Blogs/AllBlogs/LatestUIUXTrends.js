              </div>
              <p>
                Forget the UI that only happens on-screen. Now you must focus
                more on interactions that in 2022 will not only bring together
                the physical and the digital world but will also take user
                experience to an entirely new level. By now, you must have heard
                the term “metaverse” a thousand times. But before Mark
                Zuckerberg used it for his project, “metaverse” was first coined
                in the 1992 dystopian sci-fi book “Snow Crash” by Neal
                Stephenson. In the novel, it refers to a virtual space that
                blends the physical and the digital, offering a new cyber-punk
                reality and dimension for socializing, escapism, maintaining a
                virtual existence through avatars, and simply being.
              </p>
              <p>
                Likewise, the “embodied internet” as Zuckerberg describes it, is
                gearing people up for a digital experience of the future that
                will change how people connect, socialize, get business done,
                work, and live through augmented and virtual reality.
              </p>
              <div className="blog-sub-title">
                <h3>What does this rising trend mean?</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Virtual and Augmented Reality are not something new to
                companies, designers, and users. However, the means through
                which they are now being implemented and the purposes for which
                they are being applied set a revolutionary and immersive
                manifestation for people, experiences and businesses. Things
                with VR and AR are not too far from shifting from “being
                something cool” to “being a norm” in people’s lives and the ways
                they handle the serious and the fun matters of the
                existentialist basics - work, communication, interaction,
                shopping, and living.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Covid19 pandemic reminds us that the physical realm is
                changing and the world is becoming extremely digitally oriented
                with people, life, practices, and experiences moving online. If
                seen through the perspective of opportunities, such events open
                many doors for UX/UI design but also require a shift in tools
                and methods. Constructing a space of the real and the unreal,
                the new metaverse trend urges you to focus more on using AI, 3D
                graphics, blockchain technologies, user behavior analysis. And
                this type of virtual connectiveness in design is based on:
              </p>
              <p className="mb-1">- Detailed and fast process information.</p>
              <p className="mb-1">
                - Decentralized but synchronized online reality that can be
                accessed on multiple platforms anytime anywhere.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-1">
                - Changes even in terms of how UX writing is being done, this
                time with AI in mind rather than SEO metrics.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Transparent but more secure web environment and connected
                virtual experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                As of 2022, the world of design should anticipate a wave of
                innovations that use Augmented Reality and 3D. More businesses
                and fields like e-commerce sites, museums, supermarkets, medical
                institutions are expected to embrace this new trend. From 3D
                logos or texts to online museum visits that allow access to
                people anywhere in the world with the use of VR goggles and
                local apps – the possibilities for AR and VR implementations in
                UI and UX design are countless.

                <h2>Scrollytelling or Visual Storytelling</h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                Typography can empower strong digital experience by playing with
                emphasis and user behavior. However, it somehow seems to have
                exhausted itself when used alone. 2022 is offering something new
                to UI and UX by introducing scrollytelling. Masterfully done,
                this becomes a robust combination of narrative and design
                aesthetics that work better toward building “emotional design”.
                And when designed for emotion, it triggers increased user
                engagement, better retention, and makes the user feel part of
                the visual storytelling.
              </p>
              <p>
                Scrollytelling is becoming a great way to evoke emotion and
                elicit decision-making based on such cognitive reflections.
                Which only speaks for a UI and UX design that influences and
                really reflects on users’ choices. It demonstrates how readers
                don’t have to simply scan a plain text and remain engaged on a
                somewhat basic informatively raw level. Instead, they can turn
                into agents of someone else’s narrative and become part of the
                story.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thanks to scrollytelling, you make your design layout work on a
                subconscious and conscious level. Including moving elements,
                different navigation placement, unexpected animations as part of
                your scrollytelling, you can keep digital users curious, wanting
                them to interact with the app/website more, and exposing them to
                a more engaging visual experience with something that used to be
                static.
              </p>
              <p>
                One thing to keep in mind though. Be careful when choosing to
                implement such gimmicks and tricks. They are not a universal
                quirk that works positively and effectively for every project
                and purpose. Not always lively and fun cursor inputs are the
                best solution to drive bigger engagement. It all depends on the
                nature of the project you build, the industry, and the target
                audience.

              </div>
              <p>
                Data is a gold mine. But a scarce number of companies make use
                of it in the most impactful and game-changing way. Only 32% of
                business executives could create measurable value from data and
                only 27% said their data and analytical products produce
                actionable insights. In the same report, the authors also quote
                Forrester pointing out that 60-73% of all enterprise data sinks
                into the void as it never really gets analyzed. But things seem
                to be shifting the opposite way now as one of the latest UI and
                UX trends in 2022 is Data Storytelling. It is pushing the limits
                of Data Visualization into the realm of Data Storytelling with
                things like better design tools, augmented analytics, data
                democratization, and data literacy. But it also becomes an
                empowering method for UX designers to:
              </p>
              <p className="mb-1">- Bring them closer to any business goal.</p>
              <p className="mb-1">- Justify their role in big enterprises.</p>
              <p>
                - Present UX as a key differentiator that is driving
                opportunities and revenue.

                  Tooling Around Process Optimization and Design Standardization
                </h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                We live in a digital world and there is no place in it for
                ad-hoc operations, slow manual efforts, and out-of-fashion
                thinking. Especially in design. To speed up innovation and
                remain present in your design practices, know that one of the
                hottest trends right now is the use of design accelerators. An
                example of one such modern-day tool is Indigo.Design which has
                become so advanced as to streamline any process in the digital
                product design creation – design ideation, collaboration,
                prototyping, user research, usability testing, design-developer
                handoff, data analytics, code generation. But these things you
                may already know. What might have skipped your mind is the fact
                that tooling around process optimization and design
                standardization is what lets you focus on the core aspects of
                designing.

                <h2>Hyper Personalized User Experiences</h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                This never gets out of date. But it gets more complicated. With
                so many services and digital products out there, consumers have
                become really picky now. The philosophy of users stipulates
                personalization and designs that clearly make a difference
                between the general and the specific. Content, imagery, layout,
                interactions – all be personalized, please!
              </p>
              <p>
                What I mean is that the design in 2022 tends to become more and
                more user-centric. According to Adobe, 54% of people want to see
                content that really reflects on their interests. Led by the new
                UI and UX trends, designers now tend to emphasize more on
                localization, collecting behavioral data to build a 360-degree
                view of users’ personas and demographics before even starting to
                lay out the design. Giving them recommendations based on their
                location, generating the right size in an online shopping app,
                sending reminders about an artist they like who is going to
                perform in their city — this is what now prevails in UI and UX
                design. It is not about giving users an option to change the
                background color of their Instagram. Users want to get to know
                them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Such personalization is already happening in digital ads. They
                get really personal with the new ad platforms and all the user
                behavior data they collect about consumers. Given the rapid pace
                of digital transformation, things have gone beyond simply
                gathering statistics on app/website performance and analyzing
                data. It is only natural for all this to flow into UI/UX as
                well. And not only natural but even PIVOTAL. So, digital
                creators must act on that data on a UI and UX design level.
              </p>
              <p>
                UX designers have the potential to be major changemakers in our
                society. To do this ethically and efficiently requires empathy.
                One of the best ways to practice and cultivate empathy is to
                keep yourself up-to-date and connected to the world around you
                by actively learning about current events, and societal
                changes—as well as connecting with peers in and out of the tech
                industry.
              </p>
              <p>
                Focusing on genuine, industry-led insights that encompass larger
                fields like work culture, developments in UX practices, and big
                tech breakthroughs can give you the wherewithal needed to become
                an empathic, modern, and cutting-edge designer.
