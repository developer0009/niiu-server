                Facebook is an indispensable platform for companies to meet with
                their users and potential customers in a cost-effective way.
                Writing this guide is to provide a primer on how you can grasp
                the tools and set yourself up to achieve success on social media
                marketing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before we dive in, let’s get one thing out of the way. There are
                many ways to approach marketing on Facebook, but we’ll stick to
                the one we love most: inbound.
              </p>
              <p>
                The term "inbound strategy" relates to being helpful and
                relatable to your audience. It encompasses greater understanding
                of your customers' goals and cooperating with them to solve
                problems. One of the best ways to do this is to be available
                where they already invest their time, which implies you must be
                on Facebook at all times.
              </p>
              <p>
                This mindset goes hand in hand with another. Namely, showing
                value to your customers. There are numerous ways you can do this
                within a social media strategy – everything from conducting
                surveys and tutorials on the right tools, nudging anyone who
                might be interested in your intended product or service to
                actually purchase it if they haven't already (which takes
                commitment). There are people who try to claim that you must do
                a whole lot in your marketing efforts with Facebook. This is
                definitely the case if you're attempting full-time brand
                advertising with it, but fortunately for us regular mortals;
                social media marketing doesn't have to offer or cost anything
                substantial at all. If I'm talking business results, then this
                approach will take longer than non-marketing social leads which
                can produce similar gains quickly as its quality increases.
              </p>
              <p>
                Business that wishes to build an "authentic" relationship with
                their audience is able to utilize Facebook's tools. It allows
                marketers to design and disperse high-quality content that will
                be useful for users. It also provides sales and customer
                services reps to connect with consumers who are interested in a
                brand.
              </p>
              <p>
                True Facebook marketing requires a consistent, long-term
                commitment. But we promise, the awareness and demand will be
                worth it.

                Ads Manager is where you manage ad campaigns for your business.
                You can create, edit and view ad campaigns as well as access

                In Ads Manager, campaign structure is comprised of three levels,
                including the campaign, ad set and ad level. The next chart

                <h2>Facebook Campaign Buying Types</h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                When you set up your ad campaigns you can select from three
                buying types:
              </p>
              <p className="mb-1">- Auction</p>
              <p className="mb-1">- Reach and frequency</p>
              <p>- Target rating point (TRP)</p>
              <p>
                You determine your buying type before all other elements in the
                campaign structure, so much of your ad performance will depend
                on you choosing the option that best suits your budget, schedule
                or business goals.
              </p>
              <div className="blog-sub-title mt-3">
                <h3>Auction Buying</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Auction buying offers more choice, efficiency and flexibility,
                with less predictable results. Ads can be placed across
                Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Audience Network. It's
                recommended that campaigns placed on Facebook or Instagram use
                the auction buying type.

              <div className="blog-sub-title mt-3">
                <h3>Reach And Frequency Buying</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Reach and frequency buying lets you plan and buy your campaigns
                in advance, with predictable ad delivery and more control over
                your frequency settings.

                <h3>TRP Buying</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                TRP buying is limited to eligible campaigns only. TRP is a
                buying type that lets you extend, augment and complement your TV
                campaigns to Facebook and Instagram. With TRP you can plan and
                buy video campaigns using Nielsen-verified TRPs, like TV and
                other online video channels. Your ad will then be optimized
                towards Nielsen on-target delivery according to your target
                audience.

                <h2>Facebook Campaign Objectives</h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                Before choosing your campaign objective, it’s important to know
                how Facebook campaigns are structured. Your Facebook ad needs
                three parts to run: a campaign, ad set and ad. All these parts
                make up what’s called the campaign structure. Knowing how they
                work together will help your ads run the way you want them to,
                and allow you to reach out to the right people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Facebook offers a variety of different campaign objectives for
                you to choose from. Before choosing your campaign objective,
                it’s important to define.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your business goal, so you can align that with the corresponding
                objective. Choosing the right objective is important as it will
                determine how Facebook decides to deliver your ads.
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Awareness: These are objectives that generate interest in
                your product or service. Increasing brand awareness is about
                telling people what makes your business valuable.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Consideration: These are objectives that get people to think
                about your business and seek more information.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Conversion: These are objectives that encourage people
                interested in your business to buy or use your product or
                service.
              </p>

              <p>
                Using reach and frequency buying is recommended when you want to
                increase brand exposure across an audience of 200,000 or more
                people. It works best with the Reach, Brand Awareness or Video
                Views objectives. If your goal is to find the most
                cost-efficient way of promoting a specific direct response such
                as Conversions or App Installs, Facebook recommends using the
                auction buying method instead.

                <h3>What Are Dynamic Ads?</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Dynamic ads match your audience’s intent, captured from your
                website, your mobile app or elsewhere on the web (like Facebook
                or other websites), to help increase demand and sales for your
                online catalog. Dynamic ads look exactly like other ads but they
                allow you to create an ad template that automatically uses
                images and details from your catalog for items you'd like to
                advertise. A catalog is a container that holds information about
                the items in your inventory. After you create a catalog, you can
                create ads and commerce experiences that pull information from
                your catalog to show people your items. This will help you
                automatically personalize your ad creative at scale without
                having to create thousands of individual ads. There are
                currently products tailored to four different dynamic ad
                verticals. Here is when you would use them:
              </p>
              <p>
                Retail/Ecommerce Use the Retail/eCommerce vertical to reach more
                shoppers, move people to complete a sale and find new potential
                shoppers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Travel Use the Travel vertical to reach people through their
                dynamic booking window, who are weekend travelers, single
                travelers, traveling in groups and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Real Estate Use the Real Estate vertical to reach people with
                your real estate inventory. You can include elements such as the
                number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
              </p>
              <p>
                Auto Use the Auto vertical to upload your entire catalog of
                vehicle inventory with relevant details such as make, model and
                year.

              <p>
                There are four bid strategies to choose from (you can also

                <h2>Ad Formates & Placements</h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                You should choose an ad format based on your business goal and
                the types of high-quality assets available. There are six main
                ad formats:
              </p>
              <img
                src={strategicCreativeImg}
                className="img img-fluid mb-4"

                alt="Ad format and placements"
              ></img>
              <p>
                As previously mentioned, the campaign objective you choose
                should align with your overall business goals. However, it's
                important to note that the campaign objective you choose also
                determines what placements and ad formats you can use.

                <h2>Creative Best Practices</h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                Having creative images with one focal point versus many in
                product and lifestyle contexts can impact lower funnel
                attributes such as purchase intent or attributed view content
                events positively. Similarly, using context type images with one
                focal point can impact brand awareness positively.
              </p>
              <p>
                Embrace video: Video prompts both brand and direct response
                outcomes. Today's video ads are interactive, shorter and mobile.
                You can prompt action from videos, when paired with the right
                targeting, optimization and call- to-action, which makes it a
                more functional medium for direct response than it has been in
                the past.
              </p>
              <p>
                Static images and video work better together. Direct response
                campaigns that combine video and static image ads have the
                highest conversion lift outcomes compared to static-only
                campaigns. This implies that the two formats may complement each
                other in messaging and/or attract different audiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Optimization of creative can help improve results: Mobile
                advertisers can use information and insights to fuel marketing
                strategies. Testing of creative can help you optimize your
                campaign and can have a significant impact on performance.
                Optimization can also help to avoid creative fatigue. Creative
                fatigue happens when your ad performance suffers due to
                overexposure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Resolve creative fatigue: If you suspect that your ad
                performance is in decline due to creative fatigue, you should
                refresh your creative by using these three steps: Evaluate for
                creative fatigue; Review your targeting strategy and audience
                saturation; Remix creative through Facebook tools and, if
                needed, adjust your current creative.
              </p>
              <p>
                Optimize video ads for mobile viewing: Based on how people view
                content on mobile, we recommend:
              </p>
              <p className="mb-1">
                - Creating short videos (15 seconds or less)
              </p>
              <p className="mb-1">- Capturing attention quickly</p>
              <p className="mb-1">- Incorporating the brand early</p>
              <p className="mb-1">- Designing for sound-off experiences</p>
              <p>- Building for vertical viewing</p>
              <p>
                If any company misses out on using Facebook effectively, then it
                is not just wasting money, but also missing out on plenty of
                brand signals to be tapped. When we talk about facebook
                marketing, we definitely have to think about creating engaging
                content for our audience, nurturing strong relationships with
                them, and making them wait for your product's arrival. There is
                no substitute for hard work, but success on social media
                marketing is not impossible. Not just anyone can succeed on
                marketing through Facebook, but it begins with the right mindset
                and approach.
