              <p>
                If you are on social media and haven’t heard of #hashtags then
                you should know that they are an incredibly important tool. A
                hashtag is a specific word or phrase preceded by the pound
                symbol (e.g., #retail) or hash sign (#). It’s used to organize
                content into categories and facilitates the sharing of
                information on social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram,
                Facebook, etc. It helps you to add value to your content by
                making it searchable on Google Trends and enables you to track
                your keywords’ popularity. It’s also a great way to build your
                brand and engage with new audiences (remember, social media
                always drives business above all else).
              </p>
              <p>
                We must all be mindful of the risk to our individual brands,
                particularly in this age of transparency. Bearing that point in
                mind, it is imperative that we always represent ourselves and
                our companies clearly on social media platforms – both
                internally (internal customers) and externally (non-customers).
                Ultimately this is a competitive advantage for us as businesses
                but more so as individuals who need to show up every day like
                everyone else!
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet while developing a brand, there is a crucial importance of
                making sure you brand as time goes on, so it needs to be
                polished and current. What you need to realise is that your
                personal brand will also evolve over time as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Imagine having a way to search through millions of posts and
                find exactly the content that you want, whenever you need it.
                Hashtags make it easy to see all the latest trends in your
                industry or topic area so that you can stay up-to-date with
                everything happening online.
              </p>
              <p>
                The hashtag is an important tool used by many people across the
                world every day – from celebrities and influencers, bloggers and
                journalists, companies and brands - even governments! It's now
                time for YOU to start using them too!

                <h3>Brand-Specific Hashtag</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Brand-Specific Hashtag is a hashtag used by brands only. The
                name of the brand comes first followed by the social media
                username, making it easier for users to find their account and
                get help or look up information using that brand's website. A
                successful example would be something like Air Asia - #AirAsia

                <h3>Content Hashtag</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Content Hashtag is a hashtag used to share content and directly
                engage the target audience. Content Hashtag is suitable for any
                type of content, from videos about a brand to photos and even
                blog posts. Related hashtags are easy to use as well!

              </div>
              <p>
                Trending Hashtag is the most creative form of content. It's a
                hashtag that enables you to contribute without having to
                actually say something. Trending hashtags often match with other
                trending topics in the industry and word filter, based on
                location, time or topic of conversation.

              </div>

              <div className="blog-sub-title">
                <h3>1. Organizing Your Content!</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                You know as well as I, that social media can be an all consuming
                activity. Whether you are on multiple platforms or spending your
                entire day watching cat videos on YouTube — it is hard to
                maintain the interest of followers who have grown tired of
                seeing your selfies and content related to each platform they
                follow (remember time moves quicker than we do?). There’s a
                reason why some companies spend millions marketing themselves
                without investing in Facebook “likes”, Twitter followers or
                Pinterest public boards. I would venture to say that at the end
                of the day your most engaged followers will move onto other
                platforms because they get tired of seeing their brand in such a
                narrow scope on social media. Just imagine if you were able to
                expand your audience by tapping into smaller but extremely
                relevant niches?
              </p>
              <p>
                The world is changing and what was once useful no longer
                applies. Hashtags let you do just that by organizing your social
                media content and making it accessible to hungry fans of yours.
                I recommend using one main hashtag for each major portfolio as
                well a few secondary tags for extremely relevant hashtags such
                as #retail or #tech that would help organize the focus on
                specific brands rather than just general concepts like Best
                Travel Destinations and Off Road Vehicle Brands – Those are too
                broad in today’s digital era where more channels exist in two
                clicks on your smartphone than in years past.
              </p>
              <div className="blog-sub-title">
                <h3>2. Growing & Engaging Brand Clarity</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                A hashtag has purpose not just to help you create a more
                organized digital presence but also act as the ultimate means of
                communication with followers who have become confused and
                jumbled among social media platforms or content portals that no
                longer serve their needs alone (remember those days are over!).
                You see so much clutter on all channels today most people don’t
                even bother to scroll up or click on links. It does not matter
                if you have thousands of followers, hundred thousand fanatics or
                over a million strong following – it only takes one person out
                of the blue who doesn’t know how to use hashtags in their tweet
                and make your hashtag useless (and no I am not talking about
                using them incorrectly). Hashtags let you be part of their
                community, ease them into the wonderful world of social media
                while providing clear and concise direction that leads to a
                treasure trove. When used properly it creates clarity in
                marketing campaigns – if your message is focusing on one major
                objective why make yourself even more confusing?

                  3. Automation Requires No Hands & Hours Of Social Media Time
                </h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                In the past when one was ready to start marketing they first had
                to devote hours / days into figuring out everything –
                discovering if a company or product resonated with you, deciding
                on which social media platforms worked best for your target
                audience and finally fine tuning what information needed to be
                displayed. Hashtags take away all of that as it is so clear cut
                and concise you can literally streamline content in less than an
                hour! It even lets companies who want to use a content strategy
                take control of their campaign, eliminating the risk and
                uncertainty. By assigning context based hashtags you are
                instantaneously giving people direction that they follow
                instants after another person uses it in an image or idea post
                on Instagram! Your fans know exactly what you’re trying to say
                as well because your hashtag was made for them!

                <h3>Site Specific and Devaluing the #</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Hashtags, unfortunately, carry their own set of cons, one of
                which is specific to the site. It means that a hashtag found on
                Facebook does not correlate to the hashtags used on Twitter,
                Instagram, and other sites; each website keeps its own system of
                hashtags. Furthermore, using too much hashtags reduces the
                latter's strength and makes them appear to be insignificant.
                According to Juntae DeLane, founder of Digital Branding
                Institute, this can permanently cheapen your brand’s social
                media. A few hashtags are better than using multi-word phrases.

                <h3>Banned Hashtags</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Instagram has fought back with Shadowbanning due to an increase
                in phony accounts and inauthentic measures to increase an
                Instagramer's following list, such as automated bots or hundreds
                of hashtags. It is the process of preventing a user's content on
                social media in a way that the user is unaware of. This has
                allowed Instagram to filter out accounts that do not comply with
                their terms of service. Instagram has also banned a number of
                hashtags, for example, if you search for #beautyblogger on the
                search bar, a message will appear and say that it may not match
                the community guidelines. A repeated use of restricted hashtags
                can result in multiple flags being added to your account. So,
                for the best part, be safe.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hashtags have been a part of social media since the beginning,
                but they've become an essential part of marketing and
                communication. They're used to connect with other people, build
                communities, create brand awareness and even spread awareness
                about important issues. When used effectively, hashtags can be a
                powerful tool for reaching your audience and connecting with
                them in new ways.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to get the most out of hashtags, we recommend that you
                start by asking yourself these questions: What are my goals? Who
                is my target audience? What message do I want to communicate?
                Once you've answered those questions, it will make it easier for
                you to put together an efficient plan on how best to execute our
