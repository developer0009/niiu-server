                <h2>What is Affiliate Marketing?</h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                Affiliate marketing involves earning a commission by promoting a
                product or service made by another retailer or advertiser. It is
                a monetization model where an affiliate partner, which is you,
                is rewarded a payout for providing a specific result to the
                retailer or advertiser.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, let’s say you are a Direct-to-Consumer company that
                sells engagement and wedding rings. Through your affiliate
                program, you might partner with…
              </p>
              <p className="mb-1">
                - Websites focused on having budget-friendly weddings
              </p>
              <p className="mb-1">- Engagement/wedding ring review sites</p>
              <p>
                - Publishers who have the capabilities to promote sign-ups for
                your “free ring sizer kit,” thus driving high-value leads for
                you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whatever you are wanting these partners to do – drive sales,
                leads, new customers, etc. – you pay them after they’ve
                delivered on that desired action.

                <h2>How Affiliate Marketing works?</h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                Affiliate marketing is a great way for small businesses to
                generate extra income. By partnering with an affiliate network,
                you can sell their products and services and receive a
                commission for every sale that your customers make. This
                commission can be used to help finance your own business, cover
                your expenses, or even save for a rainy day. There are many
                affiliate networks out there, so it's important to find one that
                is right for you. Many affiliate networks offer many different
                types of commission structures that are tailored to the
                requirements and needs of a business.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you join an affiliate program, you can begin sending
                traffic to the merchants product(s). When your customers click
                through and make a purchase, they will receive their commission.
                How often this occurs is up to the merchant – some may pay once
                per year while others might pay at least every 90 days (often
                called rolling commissions).
              </p>

                <h2>Types of Affiliate Marketing</h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                Affiliates always carry a bit of mystery—you never know if the
                person has ever really used the product, or if they are just
                promoting it for the money. Both cases still exist today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Understanding the types of affiliate marketing can show you the
                different ways people make money online in this space,
                regardless of your moral compass.
              </p>
              <div className="blog-sub-title mt-3">
                <h3>1. Unattached</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                The first type of affiliate marketing is referred to as
                “unattached,” or when you have no authority in the niche of the
                product you’re advertising. There is no connection between you
                and the customer. Often you are running pay-per-click
                advertising campaigns with your affiliate link and hoping people
                will click it, buy the product, and earn a
                commission. Unattached affiliate marketing is attractive because
                you don’t need to do any legwork. Affiliate marketing businesses
                rely on reputation and trust with a target audience online. Some
                don’t have the time or desire to build those relationships, so
                this type of marketing is their best option.
              </p>
              <div className="blog-sub-title mt-3">
                <h3>2. Related</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Related affiliate marketing is where you promote products and
                services you don’t use, but that are related to your niche.
                Affiliates in this case have an audience, whether it’s through
                blogging, YouTube, TikTok, or another channel. They have
                influence, which makes them a trusted source for recommending
                products, even if they’ve never used it before. The problem with
                related affiliate marketing is, do you want to promote something
                you’ve never tried before? It could be the worst product or
                service ever and you wouldn’t even know. It only takes one bad
                recommendation to lose the trust of your audience. If you don’t
                have trust and transparency, it’ll be hard to build a
                sustainable affiliate marketing business.
              </p>
              <div className="blog-sub-title mt-3">
                <h3>3. Involved</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                In this type of marketing, you use your influence to promote
                products and services that followers may actually need, instead
                of paying to get clicks on a banner ad. It takes more time to
                build this type of credibility with an audience, but it’s
                necessary to build a sustainable business. You don’t have to
                hide behind expensive PPC ads and hope for clicks and sales. An
                organic Instagram Story or blog post about your experience with
                a product will go a long way.

                <h3>An affiliate program reference from our end:</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Shopify offers an affiliate program where entrepreneurs can
                refer merchants to the platform. It’s free to sign up. After a
                partner applies and gets approved, they receive a referral link.
                The partner goes and shares that link with their audiences. When
                someone signs up through the link for a paid Shopify plan, the
                affiliate partner earns a commission.

              </div>
              <div className="blog-sub-title mt-3">
                <h3>Pay Per Sale</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Pay per sale, where you earn a commission for each sale you
                make. It’s a common payout model for ecommerce offers.
              </p>
              <div className="blog-sub-title mt-3">
                <h3>Pay Per Action</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Pay per action, which earns you a commission for a specific
                action. Many affiliate programs use this payout model because
                it’s broad and can be applied to different offers: a newsletter
                signup, a click, contact request, form submission, etc.
              </p>
              <div className="blog-sub-title mt-3">
                <h3>Pay Per Install</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Pay per install, where you are paid for every install generated
                from your website traffic. The goal of your content would be to
                promote mobile apps and software so that people download or
                install them.
              </p>
              <div className="blog-sub-title mt-3">
                <h3>Pay Per Lead</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Pay per lead, which pays you every time someone signs up for
                something. It’s a popular payout method because companies use it
                for sweepstakes, lead generation, and other types of offers.
                Cost per lead offers are common for beginners because it’s
                easier to generate leads than to sell products to an audience.
              </p>
              <div className="blog-sub-title mt-3">
                <h3>Pay Per Click</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Pay per click, a rare payout system where you earn commission on
                every click on your affiliate link. Pay per click programs are
                used by big merchants with a goal to build brand awareness.
                Customers don’t need to sign up or buy anything, just to visit
                the merchant’s website.
              </p>
              <p>
                Affiliate marketing revenue eventually can become a form of
                passive income, but you still have to do some heavy lifting
                upfront. The success of your program will depend on the quality
                of your review.
              </p>
              <p>
                To create a good review, it’s best to get personal.
                Share your experience in your blog, social media post, Instagram
                Story or YouTube video. If you’re writing a personal review,
                give a candid opinion based on your experience with and
                knowledge of the product. The more open you are, the more
                authentic you will be. People will be more comfortable following
                your advice if they feel they can trust you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Trust is a key factor in your affiliate marketing efforts,
                because people need to trust you enough to act on your
                recommendations. The level of trust you’ll need to make
                affiliate sales depends on your industry and the products you’re
                recommending—for example, it takes more trust to be an effective
                affiliate for a $1,000 course than it does for a $20 t-shirt.
